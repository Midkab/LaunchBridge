# 🚀 LaunchBridge

**Build Experience. Get Hired.**

LaunchBridge is a platform that helps students and fresh graduates gain real-world experience before they land their first job — by connecting them to short-term projects, startup simulations, and entry-level job opportunities.

## 🎯 Problem

"You need experience to get a job, but you can't get a job without experience."

Millions of graduates are stuck in this cycle — especially in regions where internships are rare, and companies are hesitant to hire juniors.

## 💡 Our Solution

LaunchBridge bridges the gap between education and employment by offering:

- ✅ **Project Marketplace** — Real short-term tasks from startups, NGOs, and companies.
- 🧑‍💻 **Startup Simulator** — Students take on roles in guided simulations (e.g., CEO, developer, designer).
- 📄 **AI-Powered CV & Portfolio Feedback** — Automated improvement suggestions and skill validation.
- 💼 **Entry-Level Job Board** — Focused on remote-friendly, junior, and internship roles.
- 🔁 **Try-Before-Hire System** — Companies can test junior talent with real work before hiring.
